Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hoping I don't repeat history

Boy I'm tryna meet your mama
On a Sunday
Then make a lotta love
On a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No)
No one else, babe
'Cause I'll be

Switchin' the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switching for you

Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)
But I get tired of running
Fuck it, now I'm running with you (with you)

Said boy I'm tryna meet your mama
On a Sunday
Then make a lotta love
On a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No)
No one else babe
'Cause I'll be

Switchin' the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switching for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do (nothing)
That I won't do, switching for you

This some shit that I
Usually don't do (Yeah)
But for you I kinda
Kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me
And I'm down too
(And I'm down too)
Yeah I'm down too
Switchin' the positions for you

This some shit that I (Yeah)
Usually don't do (Don't do)
But for you I kinda
Kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me
And I'm down too
('Cause you're down for me)

Switchin' the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops (Jumping, jumping)
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switching for you (Ooh whoa)
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
That I won't do, switching for you
