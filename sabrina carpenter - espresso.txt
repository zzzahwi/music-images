Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

I can't relate
To desperation
My 'give a fucks' are on vacation
And I got this one boy
And he won't stop calling
When they act this way
I know I got em'

Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya

Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so

I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honey bee, come and get this pollen

Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya

Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
