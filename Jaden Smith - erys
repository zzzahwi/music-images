Alright boys
I got a whole palette of vision I need to go out by tonight (yeah)
I need you vigilant out there (yeah)
So keep your head up
Watch your back (yeah)
Get it done
And I'd like to see you guys argue
ERYS, I'm sure you can take it from here

Boys in the city goin' psycho
Drop this shit, man, I bet it goin' viral
Too fly, man, I had to take the high road
Too mad when they see me, Luke Skywalk
Trap talk, had to turn it to the lunch talk
Rich route and I had to take the roof off
Two doors make 'em look like Medusa
And I got a long way

ERYS
Over there blowin' up with some shit, some gang shit, nigga
That shit was hard
Hop around this shit, they in a Teflon
Rather keep the vision in my left arm
I put that on a Tesla (top secret shit)
I don't wanna hear that we next up
Been the one, second hottest to the Sun
And I guess you couldn't tell we're the grunge, fuckin' punks

'Member we're hottest in the city
Spent the - tryna get me
'Til I pull up at the party with the semi
Saw squad, showed up colors with the enemy
I don't need your money, boy, I got a deal
Talkin' to the night -, 'cause you a tattletale
Put the gang on the chain, you ain't half as real
You ain't been the same, make the city our battlefield, nigga

Tonight
This how we feel 'bout this drink
We don't let nobody disrespect us
Our culture
Fuck that, nigga
We on some of this -, muhfuckin' TP

Let's go, Cleveland, Rook, we dyin' today
Tell 'em to meet us at the fucking place, right now, we dyin'
Fuck that shit, nigga
ERYS does shit, we run the city
ERYS dies late last night
The street will eat you if you let your ego defeat you
With this I leave you

He or she who seeks good will ultimately
Have to go through what is opposite but equal
Be cognizant of these naturally-born evils
In the concrete
A story that's been written of our neighborhood heroes

Did you hear about your boy?
What happened?
ERYS, they got him last night (no)
No, last night, this nigga
Yo, but who's that floatin' up in the mountains right there?

Oh, oh
Jaden
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Damn, this nigga SYRE is back
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

She don't need my love, she just need someone else
It burns me every time, it's because she's someone else
Got old pictures of us, now she's with someone else
Keep that to yourself (keep that to yourself)
I don't need your love, I need somebody else
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell
Go nuts in the club, and don't walk on my shells
I'm so far of the edge, I'm so far off the edge

She said, "I don't need your love, I need somebody else"
It burns me every time, it's because she's someone else
Got old pictures of us, but she's with someone else
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge
I don't need your love, I just need someone else, yeah
You at my side, you tell me how to help
I'm all lost, I need you to myself
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge

Zoom, go by
We just tryna be alright, we just tryna live life
Oh, God, we alright, wanna hold you tight, yeah
Now I'm all by myself
Now you wanna need my love
She don't wanna see my love
She don't really wanna be mine, oh, oh, oh
(I'm so lost and I know)
We can wait until the sunrise
And there's no one outside
Move slow motion (I'm so lost and I know)
So much snow on the ground
That was such a fun night
Ridin' on the west side
Sorry that I threw up (I just love you, baby)

She said, "I don't need your love, I need somebody else"
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell
Go nuts in the club, and then throw up on myself
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge
She said, "I don't need your love
I need somebody else" (someone, someone)
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell (someone, someone)
Go nuts in the club, and then throw up on myself (someone, someone)
Too far off the edge
I'm too far off the edge (I just love you, baby, someone, someone)

It's like ridin' in circles with you, just, over and over again
Think you get it
SYRE, SYRE
A beautiful confusion
The story of a boy who knew solitude and exclusion
Six pills, and the pain kills
Haunted by his youth, now he's goin' through it
Remember that boy with the white fence and the stairs down to the basement?

SYRE, you still haven't learned from the fire
From that pink hue up there, you admire
You still chasin' the sky, or you a whole different guy?
2014, I was bikin' to your house every morning, it was like a mile
But that's the point besides
By now I'm slowly forgetting your eyes
I remember I woke up sick on a hill, I was cryin'
By now, that can't be a surprise
For you, I would fall off a cliff by the sea and get bit by a lion

I bet I survive
It's 7:45, I'm kickin' rocks
SYRE, sad story about a boy on a hill
Rumor has it that he's there still (never ended)
And when that tear starts to fall down your cheeks (me too)
And the sun sets in the distance
There I'll be
SYRE
(A beautiful confusion)
