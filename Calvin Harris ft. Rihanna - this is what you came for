Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
Ooh

You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
Ooh

We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothin' more than we need
I say, "Your place, " when we leave

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at you, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
Ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
Ooh

You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh
