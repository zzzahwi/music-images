You call me, all friendly, tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business, go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a -

I remember that weekend when my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision 'cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position, I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a -

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a -
So stop tryna get to me
Get up off your knees, 'cause
Boy, I don't give a -, uh, uh

About you, no, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you, now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a -
(Boy, I don't give a-)

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a -
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Get up off your knees, 'cause
Boy, I don't give a -, uh, uh
