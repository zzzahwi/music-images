When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you
Made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the Internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad

So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
Ah
Goddamn
Ah
Fuck you
Fuck you
